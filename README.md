#### This website provides CMB mock maps and catalogs generated from the FLAMINGO simulation and its model variants. The available components include CMB lensing, tSZ, kSZ, patchy screening, CIB, and radio point sources. For maps from the 2.8 Gpc box, fields are integrated up to z=4.5, while for maps from the 1 Gpc box, fields are integrated up to z=3.0. All maps have a resolution of nside=4096 and are lensed by the integrated matter field between the source and the observer. Please see ... for more details.
