# FLAMINGO Simulation

#### This website includes the CMB mock maps and catalog generated from the FLAMINGO simulation and its model variants. It includes CMB lensing, tSZ, kSZ, patchy screening, CIB and radio point source. For the maps from 2.8 Gpc box size, fields are integrated up to z = 4.5, while for the maps from 1 Gpc box size, fields are integrated up to z = 3.0. The resolution of all maps is nside = 4096. All maps are lensed by the integrated matter field between the source and the observer. Please see... for more details.
